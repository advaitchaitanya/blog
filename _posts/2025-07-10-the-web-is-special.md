title: The Web Is Special
---

Three months ago I launched a graphic and web design studio called First Pulse.

First Pulse is an ode to the innate desire within me to translate the formless joy we are into a display of shape, type, and color—held in space, to bring out what really matters to you. I believe that we all have a commitment or governing force that's silently guiding our way to fuller expression. My hope is that through the last seven years I've spent in spiritual study, coupled with a background in design and programming, I can help you bring that force to life through the medium of the web.

And, I feel the web is a perfect platform for expressing that. The web is special, because it's one of the few places in technology which so beautifully mirrors the natural world—a decentralized system where an array of diversity retains it's individuality, while effortlessly co-existing and communicating with one another. The web is also transparent, where the underlying code running a site is one click away from view. These principles of unity in diversity and open knowledge are absolutely essential in our world today, which can feel so hierarchal and isolative.

Today, as I reflect on 33 years of living, my heart is feeling grateful to be actively embodying a commitment—a lifelong commitment to speak—and, to be given a beautiful community to share that. I've always wanted to use my voice for the greater good, which has guided me in song, studying the Advaita philosophy, and using the power of language to build a better world wide web.

I'm currently available for accepting a few intentional web design projects. So, if you or someone you know is eager to discover that pulse and bring it to this platform, reach out. I'd love to collaborate.
