What does it mean to be centered? Being at center is abiding in the Self—a place in which all the masks worn are seen. Being at center means to see every moment as a death experience. It is the continual dance of death performed on the stage of the Self. Perhaps having dedication or a commitment is developing the art of dying continually to one’s own shapes and reshaping oneself on a higher value—a Light which transcends. And, as that Light fall upon the mind, a total reorganizing takes place; it makes its way to every cell. So, all that is needed is to allow this death to happen—an acknowledgement of the limitations of all matter.

To clearly see the impermanence of all things is the accent. Light is the decent. And, that Light’s expression is heaven on earth. Being at centre is just Being, which is a truly creative place.
