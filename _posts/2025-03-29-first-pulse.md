Today, I'm officially launching a passion project I've been ruminating on for the last few years. It's a graphic and web design studio called First Pulse. Iâ€™m deeply inspired and continually nourished by the non-dual teachings of my Guru, Swami Bodhananda. And those teachings, including the insights I find throughout the Upanishads we study, sparked a new passion in me for reimagining Vedic culture and exploring what a modern Rishi could look like.

The root "rsh" in Rishi means to keep moving. And, what we need today is a generation that's disciplined enough to immerse themselves in the wisdom of scripture, while also being largehearted enough to dive into the world, offering their unique gifts. The new Rishi should be able to flow between these worlds and that's what Advaita's all about. The world is never away from the spirit. When we engage in society from that perspective, good things manifest and new ideas arise. That's my experience.

First Pulse is an attempt to be a better bridge. From hosting classes on Upanishad and Yoga at the ashram, to connecting with other human beings in our community, who seek to express their voice through design, I have one hope: may I help you discover your first pulse&mdash;what you care about most&mdash;and bring it to life.

If you or a good friend you know needs a logo, website, or any kind of design work, shoot me a message. Check out our portfolio at [firstpulsestudio.com](https://firstpulsestudio.com/) and let's collaborate!
