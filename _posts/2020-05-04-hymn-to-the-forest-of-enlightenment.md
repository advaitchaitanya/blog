![Sambodharanya](/assets/images/2020-05-04.jpg "Sambodharanya")

I bow down to Sambodharanya, which is the embodiment of Shiva. The Red-tailed hawk soars over this pristine forest; meditation is effortlessly reached by such a sight. I pay obeisance to the Lord of Sambodharanya, who imposes Himself on every creature and makes this state available. All of these branches intricately shape themselves to reach the sun. Similarly, we are shaping ourselves to reach the source of light. To that source—the Lord of Sambodharanya—I prostrate.

By traversing Sambodharanya and being present, the mind is filled with wonder. In awe, know everything to be an appearance of God. This conviction, which should be nurtured, is called Viveka.

There is not one thing that contains happiness. Knowing this, happily watch the forest burst into existence each day and vanish into nothingness every night. One who cultivates Vairagya is happy.

Buds blossoming on the branch, like our minds, continually change. Giving up seeking stability in anything which changes is Shama. Dama is the ability to watch the scenery of sensations.

The sun has no preference on how it dances through the shade; it simply shines. Similarly, one who’s personality and work is no longer fueled by their wounds is practicing Uparama. The willingness to gain an understanding around these wounds is Titiksha.

Deer take shelter by the pine trees, which are pure and consistent throughout the season. Take shelter in the Guru and Vedanta by faithfully trusting their words. They are the crystallization of Truth—purity and consistency itself. This is known as Shraddha.

The winding brook is clear and moving in one direction. A mind steadily flowing towards God is called Samadhana. One who possesses such a mind is willing to traverse any landscape to reach the goal. Mumukshutvam is the willingness to give up anything to be with the Lord of Sambodharanya.

May this hymn inspire your practice. May you deeply reflect on these verses and experience the ever-present joy—Shiva. May you wander the forest of this world, knowing yourself and all that you see as Him alone.
