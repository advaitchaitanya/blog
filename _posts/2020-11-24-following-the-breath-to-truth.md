I surrender to the universal Prana, which is Shiva.

The purity of Sambodh Aranya, which is God’s expression, uplifts our minds and makes this pursuit possible.

One breath in this pristine forest can guide the mind inwards—waking us up from our imaginary limitations. I bow to the source of this breath and the glistening, snow covered woodland.

The conservation of natural environments is critical to our progression and wellbeing. If we want to know the Truth, we must take the help of nature. Nature exists for our enjoyment and the recognition of our inherent freedom. Our sacred texts tell us that inquiry leads to recognizing this ever-present freedom.

How do we recognize our freedom? In what way should we inquire? Where do we begin?

We must have a suitable environment, hence the importance of respecting and conserving nature. It must be simple and clean. The air should be pure; it’ll be our guide. Our environment is an extension of our body.

Pure air is the gift of nature. It supports all life. Let us recognize the interrelationship of air and life. “My body is supported by this air. I can’t live a moment without it. This air is a gift from my environment.”—Devotion is the way.

“There is something more to this air. It moves in five ways through my body. When my breath is steady and balanced, I experience happiness.”—This is Prana.

Apana is that way in which this air moves down. It takes care of the process of elimination.

“The air circulates my blood, which nourishes the different parts of my body.”—This is Vyana.

Samana is that way in which the air guides the assimilation of nutrients from the food we consume.

“My eyes are wet with tears as I reflect on the beauty of Sambodh Aranya and the importance of this breath.”—That upward rush is Udana. 

What is beauty? What is this breath?

By Udana, all thoughts emerge. Our thoughts create this entire universe we perceive and interact in. As the breath becomes pure, the thoughts become settled. As the thoughts settle, the Truth is revealed.

Truth is beauty; beauty is nature; nature is breath; breath is the life force; that force is God.

“Thoughts rise up in me, beginning with the thought “I”. Then, they create my pleasure, intellect, emotions, breath, and body. Through this body, mind, and ego, I see the world.”—This is the way of inquiry.

“Each night, the world I perceive vanishes in sleep. Where is the freedom in this world?”—This is the way of inquiry.

“I am seeing more clearly. Everything is appearing in me. Who am I?”—This is the way of inquiry.

The Teacher says, “Pure air leads to pure breath; pure breath leads to pure thought; pure thought explodes into pure Consciousness.”

The student rejoices, “The Truth never changes. At all times, I exist. I am that silent Shiva.”

“I am the foundation from which everything is known. I am that Consciousness—Shiva.”

“All that I see inside and out appears in me. There is no other. I am that dancing, blissful Shiva! Teacher, you have blessed me.”

The Teacher smiles and says, “We scale mountain tops together. Go and share the path of breath. Be that Shiva. Express the joy of Shiva. Serve all by happily doing your work. Bring light to this world.”
