In the search of perfection, we often try to fix the world; we look to change our environment and people. Our hearts bleed at the thought of people suffering. It’s a painful sensation. This desire for change—a yearning for real peace—is not bad. This deep search for perfection is actually a qualification for spiritual seekers. To detach the mind from all objective things by continually seeing their imperfection, and to direct it steadfastly toward Brahman, it’s goal—this is called tranquility<sup>1</sup>. But, in our attempt to better the world, we focus on a part and miss the big picture.

There's no need to worry about serving others or changing the world. First, we must learn to bring ourselves back to center. Being at center means abiding in Brahman or God. God is happiness. Why do we want to end suffering? Is it not for happiness alone? The reflection on the source of happiness is what we call meditation. Through meditation, we come in direct contact with the Self. When we can move from this center, service becomes effortless and spontaneous. I once asked Swami about this:

“How can I best serve and help those who are suffering?”

He said, “By yourself being a happy person and joyfully going about doing your work and sharing your bliss.”
Remaining in the Self is not opposed to serving others. In fact, our gifts will naturally bloom according to the situation.
